# Student-Register-
Used Binary Search Tree to implement the student register by  insertion, deletion and other function like search, Ascending -  Descending order ,etc. A user will able to sort all student by name,  search a perticular student by name. This will help user when the list  of students is not sorted due to temporary number given  at admission time
